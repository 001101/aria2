aria2 1.4.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release adds XML-RPC interface and the ability to run command
when download started/stopped and the ability to save cookies.  The
current XML-RPC API allows users to add http(s)/ftp/torrent/Metalink
download and change options dynamically.  The APIs such as reporting
download progress, file paths, URIs and peer information are also
available. For complete API specification, see XML-RPC INTERFACE
section in man page and
http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/aria2/wiki/XmlrpcInterface. The
console readout was slightly updated and now includes the number of
seeders the client has connected to.  Slovak translation was
added. Ukrainian and Brazilian Portuguese translation were updated.

Changes
-------

* Added Slovak translation. Updated Ukrainian and Brazilian Portuguese
  translation. Thanks to all translators.

* Use name.utf-8 and path.utf-8 key in higher priority than name and
  path key respectively when persing .torrent file.

* Added --xml-rpc-max-request-size option to limit the size of XML-RPC
  request.

* Since upcoming libgnutls 2.8 doesn't have libgnutls-config, Check
  presence of libgnutls using pkg-config first. If it fails, fall back
  to old macro libgnutls.m4.

* Added --save-cookies option.

* Added the ability to execute command when download starts and
  stops. You can also specify command for particular cases such as
  complete/error download.  Added --on-download-start,
  --on-download-stop, --on-download-complete and --on-download-error
  option.

* Abbreviated KiB/s to KiBs and its precision decreased to 1 to save
  space in console readout. Also they are now shown in MiB/s if speed
  > 1024KiB/s.

* Added SEED to console output, which represents the number of seeders
  currently the client is connecting to.

* Added source filename(__FILE__) and line number(__LINE__) to
  exception message.

* Fixed the bug that POU peers are never choked in seeding.

* DownloadResult now has the list of FileEntry.  The download summary
  displays the path of first selected file and the number of remaining
  files for multi-file torrent.

* Added BASIC authentication for XML-RPC. Added --xml-rpc-user and
  --xml-rpc-passwd option.

* Added XML-RPC interface. See complete API specification at
  http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/aria2/wiki/XmlrpcInterface

* Removed --enable-http-server and --http-server-listen-port options.
  Added --enable-xml-rpc and --xml-rpc-listen-port instead.  The
  original feature for --enable-http-server that reports download
  progress in HTML was officially removed.  Persist XML-RPC connection
  if client supports keep-alive.

 * Added more options that can be specified in -i list and xml-rpc
   add* command. See Input File in aria2c man page.
