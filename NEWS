aria2 1.7.2
===========

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug that aria2 listens wrong port in
BitTorrent/FTP downloads when --interface option is used. If
--metalink-file='-' is given, aria2 now reads Metalink file from
stdin. Magnet URI is printed in the output of -S option.  DHT is
now enabled by default.  DHT doesn't start while aria2 only handles
HTTP/FTP downloads. On the first torrent download begins, aria2
initiates DHT functionality. After that, DHT runs until aria2 exits

Changes
-------

 * Fixed the bug that RequestGroupMan::downloadFinished() returns true
   even if all downloads haven't finished, especially when
   PostDownloadHandler is involved. Changed the condition so that it
   only returns true if both _requestGroups and _reservedGroups are
   empty.

 * Enabled DHT by default because of Magnet URI support. To disable
   DHT, use --enable-dht=false

 * Print Magnet URI in -S output.

 * Fixed the bug that line separator is missing in horizontal bar in
   aria2mon.

 * If '-' is given as an argument to --metalink-file option, aria2
   reads Metalink file from stdin.

 * Fixed the bug that aria2 listens wrong port if --interface option
   is used.

 * Fixed the bug that query parameter in magnet URI is not decoded.

aria2 1.7.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release adds BitTorrent Magnet URI support.  3 options were
added: the ability to bind to particular interface, disabling IPv6 and
prioritizing piece in BitTorrent downloads.  In configure script, if
--with-PACKAGE and --enable-FEATURE are given but PACKAGE is missing
in the system or FEATURE cannot be enabled in the current
configuration, the script now prints error message and exits.
--http-auth-scheme option was removed since it is useless.  Updated
Russian, Ukrainian, German and French translations.

Changes
-------

 * Updated Russian, Ukrainian, German and French translations.  Thanks
   to all translators involved.

 * Use last 8 bytes of peer ID as 'key' parameter for tracker request.

 * Added --disable-ipv6 option to disable IPv6.

 * In configure script, if --with-PACKAGE and --enable-FEATURE are
   given and PACKAGE is missing in the system or FEATURE cannot be
   enabled, print error message and stop the script.

 * Added --interface option.  This feature binds sockets to given
   interface. You can specify interface name, IP address and hostname.

 * Removed --http-auth-scheme option since it is useless.

 * Added --bt-request-peer-speed-limit, --bt-max-peers and
   --bt-prioritize-piece option to changeOption XML-RPC method.

 * Added option --bt-prioritize-piece.  This option instruct aria2 to
   try to download first and last pieces of each file first. This
   option is useful for previewing files. The argument can contain 2
   keywords:head and tail. To include both keywords, they must be
   separated by comma. These keywords can take one parameter,
   SIZE. For example , if head=SIZE is specified, pieces in the range
   of first SIZE bytes of each file get higher priority. tail=SIZE
   means the range of last SIZE bytes of each file. SIZE can include K
   or M(1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K).

 * Use host and protocol in original URI to record server's speed,
   because URI selector selects URI based on original URI, not
   redirected one.

 * Fixed the bug which causes segmentation fault with tellWaiting
   XML-RPC method when BitTorrent download is waiting.

 * Added support of Extension for Peers to Send Metadata Files(BEP9)
   and BitTorrent Magnet URI. Now addUri XML-RPC method accepts
   BitTorrent Magnet URI. Metalink resource type 'bittorrent' also
   accepts BitTorrent Magnet URI.

 * Fixed the bug that slow server is not knocked down in favor of
   faster one.

 * Applied a patch from tizianomueller to fix sigbus errors on Linux
   sparc. I modified the patch to eliminate a cast to uint32_t* and
   include file ordering.
