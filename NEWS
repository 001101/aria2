aria2 1.5.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release adds WEB-Seeding support for multi-file torrent.
--bt-stop-timeout option was added. This function stops BitTorrent
download if the download speed is 0 in consecutive given seconds.
aria2 now tries all resolved addresses to connect to remote servers in
HTTP(S)/FTP until it gets connected.  For XML-RPC, two new methods
were added: aria2.tellWaiting and aria2.getVersion. The error code is
available in the response of aria2.tellStatus methods for
stopped/completed downloads.  --use-head is now disabled by default
since using HEAD request causes problems in some web sites.  The
behavior of -D option has been changed: If -D is specified, the
current working directory is set to / and stdin, stdout and stderr are
redirected to /dev/null.  This release fixes the bug that zombie
processes are created when commands specified in --on-download-*
options are executed and the bug that http-user, http-passwd, ftp-user
and ftp-passwd are ignored when they are given via XML-RPC.  Updated
Russian, Italian, Danish, Bulgarian, Japanese and Ukrainian
translations.

Changes
-------

 * Updated Russian, Italian, Danish, Bulgarian, Japanese and Ukrainian
   translations. Thanks to all translators.

 * Avoid to create zombie process when commands specified in
   --on-download-* options are executed.

 * Fixed the bug that http-user, http-passwd, ftp-user and ftp-passwd
   are ignored when they are given via XML-RPC.

 * Added 'errorCode' to the reponse of tellStatus xml-rpc method.
   This key is only available for stopped/completed downloads and its
   value is the error code defined in EXIT STATUS in man page.

 * Implemented getVersion xml-rpc method. This method returns struct
   which has 2 key-value pairs: "version" key is associated to the
   version of aria2, such as "1.5.0". "enabledFeatures" key is
   associated to the list of enabled features, such as "Async DNS",
   "BitTorrent".

 * Removed TLS1.1 protocol support when aria2 is built with gnutls for
   compatibility issue.

 * Disabled --use-head option by default because --use-head=true
   causes problems on some web sites.

 * Print URL List in -S option for torrent.

 * Added --bt-stop-timeout=SEC option. This function stops BitTorrent
   download if the download speed is 0 in consecutive SEC seconds. By
   default, this function is disabled.

 * Throw exception if file path doesn't exist in FTP URL.

 * Try all available addresses returned by DNS until it gets connected
   in HTTP(S)/FTP download

 * Don't print "No files to download." message if -S is given.

 * Added support of WEB-Seeding for multi-file torrent.

 * Added tellWaiting XML-RPC method.

 * The default value of --dir option is the absolute path to the
   current directory. If getcwd() is failed, then it is ".", which is
   the same value with old implementation. This change is necessary
   because after daemon() call, the current working directory is
   changed to /.

 * Call daemon() with arguments(0,0), which means daemon() changes
   current working directory to / and redirects stdin, stdout and
   stderr to /dev/null.
