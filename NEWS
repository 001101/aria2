aria2 1.6.1
===========

Release Note
------------

This release fixes memory leak in HTTP/FTP download. It also fixes the
bug that the option values changed by XML-RPC changeOption and
changeGlobalOption methods are cleared.  Now User-agent and Peer ID
include version number.  Updated Simplified Chinese translations.

Changes
-------

 * Don't save control file when aria2 exits while checking piece
   hash(behavior of -V option). If control file doesn't exist when
   aria2 launches, the completed length in saved control file will be
   0 byte and this confuses user.

 * Included version number in Peer ID and client version.  Peer ID now
   starts with "aria2/VERSION-", where VERSION is
   MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO. Client version is aria2/VERSION.

 * Included version number in user-agent string.

 * Fixed memory leak in HTTP/FTP download.

 * Fixed the bug that the option values changed by XML-RPC
   methods(changeOption and changeGlobalOption) are overwritten to the
   previous value by the next these requests which doesn't contain
   that option value.

 * Added missing help message for remove command to aria2rpc.



aria2 1.6.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release changes the default behavior of XML-RPC server. Now it
listens only on local loopback interface by default for security
reasons. If you want to connect to aria2c from remote hosts, use
--xml-rpc-listen-all option. The XML-RPC client sample script written
in Ruby are now included in the archive under doc/xmlrpc directory.
These scripts are licensed under MIT License. The help category tags
are now start "#" to distinguish them from keyword search. Several
help category tags were added: #xml-rpc, #cookie, #hook and #file.
--retry-wait option was removed because it doesn't work properly under
the architecture. Updated Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak and Japanese
translations.

Changes
-------

 * Added XML-RPC in -v Configuration output.

 * Updated Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak and Japanese
   translations. Thanks to all translators.

 * Removed --retry-wait option since the current architecture doesn't
   allow sleep for particular URI.

 * Removed Retry-After header support since the current architecture
   doesn't allow sleep for particular URI.

 * Added our own daemon() function for systems which desn't have
   daemon(3).

 * Added help category tag #file. Added #file tag to the options
   related to downloaded file.

 * Added help category tags: #cookie and #hook. Added #https tag to
   --https-proxy and --https-proxy, --all-proxy and --no-proxy.

 * A help category tag now starts with "#" to distinguish a category
   from keyword search. For example, "http" tag is now "#http". You
   can type "--help=#http" to get explanation of options related to
   http. If '#' is omitted, then the argument is treated as a keyword
   and aria2 searches options whose name includes the keyword and
   print matched ones. For example, "--help=http" will show options
   whose name includes "http".

 * Added xml-rpc help tag. Tagged xml-rpc related options with
   xml-rpc tag.

 * Fixed the bug that server performence profile is not updated when
   aria2c was terminated by emergency shutdown.

 * Added XML-RPC client scripts written in ruby.

 * Added support for IPv6 literal address in URI. Now aria2 can
   handle URI such as http://[::1]/

 * Fixed the bug that HTTP request header for XML-RPC request is not
   parsed properly.

 * Added --xml-rpc-listen-all option. If true is given to this option,
   aria2 listens incoming XML-RPC requests on all network
   interfaces. If false is given, listens only on local loopback
   interface. The default value is false.
