aria2 1.3.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release adds the ability to specify the output filenames in
BitTorrent downloads and the option to limit overall download speed
and dry run mode which just checks the availability of the remove
file. -i list option can now take more options: select-file and
index-out.  The default behavior of sending HTTP Authorization header
is reverted back to version 1.1.2 style. The bug in
AdaptiveURISelector was fixed.  You can now seed read-only files in
BitTorrent.

Indonesian, Russian, Italian, Ukrainian and Simplified Chinese
translations were updated.

Changes
-------

* Changed the default value of --uri-selector option from 'inorder' to
  'feedback'
	
* Included current URI in exception message.
	
* Fixed the bug that AdaptiveURISelector doesn't select any URI when
  all URIs are tested and their timeout is not reached.

* Reuse URIs when all unused URIs run out.

* Removed --direct-file-mapping option and CopyDiskAdaptor.

* Added --dry-run option.  In this mode, aria2 just checks whether
  the remote file is available and doesn't download data. This
  option has effect on HTTP/FTP downloads and BitTorrent downloads
  are canceled in this mode.

* Parse options in -i list using OptionParser.

* Don't reset URI in retry to avoid additional round trips because
  of redirects.	

* Added --index-out option to specify each file path for torrent.
  Here index shown in --show-files option is used to specify which
  file path should be altered. For example, to change the file path
  with index=2, use --index-out=2=aria2.tar.bz2. You can use this
  option multiple times: --index-out=1=aria2.tar.bz2
  --index-out=2=aria2-opt.tar.bz2. The short hand form -O is also
  available. This option can be specified in -i list.

* Added --max-overall-download-limit option.  Now --max-upload-limit
  option is not ignored when --max-overall-upload-limit option has
  non-zero value. aria2 checks download(upload) speed in the order:
  first checks overall speed limit and if it is not exceeded, then
  checks speed limit per download.  Thus you can specify both
  value. For example, set --max-overall-download-limit=1M and
  --max-download-limit=500K to prevent from one download from eating
  all overall speed limit.

* Now select-file can be specified in the uri list(-i list).

* Made the upper value of --max-concurrent-downloads options unlimited.

* Fixed the bug that disk writer is not created even if it shares same
  piece with the preceding file if the length of previous file is 0.

* In BitTorrent, Open files in read-only mode for hash check.  After
  that, re-open file in read/write mode only when the download is
  not finished.	

* Added --http-auth-challenge option.  If it is set to true, aria2
  sends HTTP authorization header only when it is requested by the
  server. If false is set, then authorization header is always sent to
  the server. This is useful for servers that don't respond 401 code
  when authentication is required.  There is an exception: if username
  and password are embedded in URI, authorization header is always
  sent to the server regardless of this option. The default value of
  this option is false.
