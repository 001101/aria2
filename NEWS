aria2 1.22.0
============

Release Note
------------

This release adds new feature that manages the number of concurrent
downloads dynamically.  --stream-piece-selector option gets new value
"random" which randomizes the piece selection for HTTP/FTP downloads.
This effectively randomizes the order of files on multi-file Web
Seeding.  Now all contributor's names are in AUTHORS file.
Previously, aria2 shows error when it sees floating point number in a
torrent file because torrent file specification does not allow
floating point number.  In this release, they are just ignored, and
aria2 continues to parse the rest of the torrent file as if there is
nothing wrong.

  downloads as a function of the overall bandwidth observed
