aria2 1.2.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release includes the AdaptiveURISelector patch from Mandriva
developers.  The several BitTorrent options were added: limiting the
number of peers and choosing port randomly from specified range and a
toggle to seed after successful hash check. Hash checking is now done
sequentially rather than simultaneously.  HTTP Authorization was also
refined so that now authorization header is sent to the server only
when it is requested(there are some exceptions, see Changes
below). This release also adds experimental built-in HTTP server which
provides the current download progress in plain html.

Changes
-------

* Applied AdaptiveURISelector-timeout patch from Pascal Rigaux at
  Mandriva. I modified the patch: make RequestGroup have the timeout
  value and AdaptiveURISelector directly modifies that value.

* Use LongestSequencePieceSelector for HTTP/FTP/BitTorrent integrated
  downloads. This PieceSelector subclass finds the longest continuous
  sequence in the available missing pieces and selects the last index
  of such sequence. This makes HTTP/FTP connections less interrupted
  by the pieces obtained by BitTorrent peers.

* Fixed the bug that the average speed is wrong in http/ftp/BitTorrent
  integrated download. Only the download bytes in BitTorrent were
  considered.

* Choose port for BitTorrent/DHT randomly from the specified range.
  REQUEST#2543518

* Send HTTP Authorization header only if it is requested by the
  server(response 401). There are some exceptions. The authorization
  header for proxy is always sent if it is available without request
  by the server.  If username/password is specified in the URI, it is
  immediately sent to the server without request by the server.
  Implements REQUEST#2540844.

* Remove leading "--" from help keyword and a substring after "=" from
  help keyword, so that one can query options by '-h--max-' or
  '-hmax-peers=10'.

* Added experimental built-in HTTP server. Currently, when a client
  accesses to the server, it responds with the current download
  progress. By default, it is disabled. To enable the server, give
  --enable-http-server option.  To change the default port number for
  the server to listen to, use --http-server-listen-port option.  The
  response HTML is very simple and refreshes it self each 1 second.
  Because of this refresh, you see flicker in normal web browser such
  as Firefox.  I recommend to use console-based browser such as
  elinks, w3m.  To connect to the server, run 'elinks
  http://localhost:6800/' while running aria2. Please replace port
  number '6800'(which is default) with your preference.

* Made (piece) hash check sequential for each RequestGroup because
  simultaneous hash check is slower than sequential execution.

* Added --bt-max-peers option to specify the maximum number of peers
  per torrent. 0 means unlimited number of peers. REQUEST#2451382

* Added --bt-hash-check-seed option.  If true is given to this option,
  after hash check using --check-integrity option and file is
  complete, continue to seed file. If you want to check file and
  download it only when it is damaged or incomplete, set this option
  to false.  This option has effect only on BitTorrent download.  The
  default value is true(This is the same behavior with the previous
  release).

* Made the max value of split option unlimited. REQUEST#2496748

* Added --event-poll option to select the method for polling events.
  The available methods are "select" and "epoll". "epoll" is
  available on Linux only. The earlier release has the compile
  option to choose from these methods.

* Included RecoverableException.h from main.cc. BUG#2498160

* Applied exit-status patch from Pascal Rigaux at Mandriva.  aria2 now
  returns last error encountered in the HTTP/FTP downloads as a exit
  status value.  If all downloads finished successfully, aria2 returns
  0.  The error code is defined in src/DownloadResult.h.  The error
  occurred in the download currently in progress is not reported as a
  last error.  If no error has encountered but there are in progress
  or waiting downloads, aria2 returns 7.

* Applied AdaptiveURISelector patch from Aurelien Lefebvre.  This
  patch adds AdaptiveURISelector, which selects one of the bests
  mirrors for first and reserved connections. For supplementary
  ones, it returns mirrors which has not been tested yet, and if
  each of them already tested, returns mirrors which has to be
  tested again. Otherwise, it doesn't return anymore mirrors.

* Fixed unit test error in HTTPResponseTest. PATCH#2485509
