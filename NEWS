aria2 1.1.0
===========

Release Note
------------
This release fixes the many bugs such as buggy HTTP pipelining
implementation that leads to corrupted downloads, bad cookie handling
and sending bad formed URI to the tracker. --max-overall-upload-limit
option was added to controll overall(not per torrent) upload speed.

From this release, aria2 validates the server certificate of HTTPS
servers by default. --with-ca-bundle compile time option is added to
specify the default path to the CA bundle. For example, Debian
provides /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt, therefore run configure
with --with-ca-bundle='/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'

The most big change in this release is that the package name is
changed from "aria2c" to "aria2". This changes the installation
directory of the documents and the translation files(*.mo). Now the
documents are installed in $prefix/share/doc/aria2 and the each
translation file is named as aria2.mo

Changes
-------

* Print the contents of torrent/metalink files without -T/-M options.

* Updated French, Japanese, Russian and Ukrainian translations.
  Thanks to all translators.

* Rename file by appending digits if a local file exists and its file
  size is larger than that of remote file with --continue option. The
  old implementation just throws exception in such case.

* Fixed the bug that download progress summary is not printed in the
  interval specified by the option.

* Fixed the cookie implementation based on RFC2965.  Now if a value in
  domain field is not started with dot, then prepend dot. That means a
  cookie with domain=sf.net is sent to wiki.sf.net.

* Fixed the bug that causes corrupted downloads if HTTP pipelining is
  enabled and the server doesn't support keep-alive.

* Added --max-overall-upload-limit option. This option limits the
  overall upload speed.  Stated in help message that the existing
  --max-upload-limit option limits the upload speed per each torrent.
  Man page is also updated.

* Fixed the bug that bad URI is sent to the tracker when the announe
  URI in torrent file includes query.

* Enabled --check-certificate by default.  Added compile
  time(configure) option --with-ca-bundle to specify CA bundle.  Warn
  if --check-certificate=true and --ca-certificate is not specified or
  loading CA certificate is failed.

* Added "https" tag to help option category.  Added https tag to
  --ca-certificate, --certificate, --check-certificate and --private-key
  option.

* Changed the package name from "aria2c" to "aria2".  The name of the
  executable is not changed. This change was done in order to fix the
  inconsistency of the package name and the install directory since in
  many distributions the binary package name is "aria2", but the old
  releases tried to install to "aria2c" directory such as
  "/usr/local/share/doc/aria2c".

* Fixed typos in man page.

* RFC3986 complied Percent-Encoding(urlencode).  Use uppercase
  hexadecimal digits for encoded text instead of lowercase ones.

* Fixed the bug that -pfalse and -ptrue are not recognized properly.

* Fixed the bug that prevents aria2 from downloading 0-length files
  via HTTP/FTP.
