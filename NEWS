aria2 1.5.0
===========

Release Note
------------

This release adds WEB-Seeding support for multi-file torrent(in other
words, integrating BitTorrent downloads with HTTP(S)/FTP). aria2 now
tries all resolved addresses to connect to remote servers in
HTTP(S)/FTP until it gets connected. aria2.tellWaiting XML-RPC method
was added to get the download entries in the waiting queue.  The
behavior of -D option has been changed: If -D is specified, the
current working directory is set to / and stdin, stdout and stderr are
redirected to /dev/null.  --use-head is now disabled by default since
using HEAD request causes problems in some web sites.
--bt-stop-timeout option was added. This function stops BitTorrent
download if the download speed is 0 and the number of seeder is 0 in
consecutive given seconds.

Changes
-------

 * Disabled --use-head option by default because --use-head=true
   causes problems on some web sites.

 * Print URL List in -S option for torrent.

 * Added --bt-stop-timeout=SEC option. This function stops BitTorrent
   download if the download speed is 0 and the number of seeder is 0
   in consecutive SEC seconds. By default, this function is disabled.

 * Throw exception if file path doesn't exist in FTP URL.

 * Try all available addresses returned by DNS until it gets connected
   in HTTP(S)/FTP download

 * Don't print "No files to download." message if -S is given.

 * Added support of WEB-Seeding for multi-file torrent.

 * Added tellWaiting XML-RPC method.

 * The default value of --dir option is the absolute path to the
   current directory. If getcwd() is failed, then it is ".", which is
   the same value with old implementation. This change is necessary
   because after daemon() call, the current working directory is
   changed to /.

 * Call daemon() with arguments(0,0), which means daemon() changes
   current working directory to / and redirects stdin, stdout and
   stderr to /dev/null.
