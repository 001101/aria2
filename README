--------------
The filename of the downloaded file is determined as follows:

single-file mode:
    If "name" key is present in .torrent file, filename is the value of "name"
    key. Otherwise, filename is the basename of .torrent file appended by
    ".file". For example, .torrent file is "test.torrrent", then filename is
    "test.torrent.file".
    The directory to store the downloaded file can be specified by -d option.
multi-file mode:
    The complete directory/file structure mentioned in .torrent file is
    created.
    The directory to store the top directory of downloaded files can be
    specified by -d option.

Note:
*  -o option is used to change the filename of downloaded .torrent file.
* This version only supports compact peers list format.
* The ports aria2c uses are 6881-6999.
* The maxmum number of peers are 55.
